# Databricks Dotfiles

A special set of Databricks and Windows dotfiles:

- `windows.bashrc` for Windows,
- `databricks.bashrc` for Databricks,
- `databricks.vimrc` for Databricks.

These are targeted at Windows machines using Git Bash and Vim.  We cannot use Vim, and do not have administrator access on Windows.

The Databricks environment cannot install any packages, which means no Vim plugins.

TODO
- how to include the aliases and funcs so it's easy to copy over and also maintain
