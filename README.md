# Dotfiles

Setup and configuration for a terminal first developer workflow.

My Neovim setup is in [nvim](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dotfiles/tree/master/nvim).

Setup `.bashrc` & `.zshrc` in `$HOME` and configure Git:

```bash
$ make dotfiles
```

Setup an Ubuntu machine:

```bash
$ make ubuntu
```

Setup a global Python installation in a pyenv virtual environment:

```shell-session
$ make python-general
```
